On	NN	O	B-S
the	NN	O	O
NATO	NN	O	O
conference	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
well	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
mean	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
obvious	NN	O	O
question	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
why	NN	O	O
should	NN	O	O
NATO	NN	O	O
exist	NN	O	O
?	NN	O	O

In	NN	O	B-S
fact	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
ask	NN	O	O
questions	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O
why	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
should	NN	O	O
ever	NN	O	O
have	NN	O	O
existed	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
but	NN	O	B-S
now	NN	O	O
why	NN	O	O
should	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
exist	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
mean	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
theory	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
whether	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
believe	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
or	NN	O	O
not	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
would	NN	O	O
be	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
defensive	NN	O	O

against	NN	O	O
potential	NN	O	O
Soviet	NN	O	O
aggression	NN	O	O

that	NN	O	B-S
’s	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
basic	NN	O	O

Well	NN	O	B-S
there	NN	O	O
’s	NN	O	O
no	NN	O	O
defense	NN	O	O

so	NN	O	B-S
whether	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O

doctrine	NN	O	O

not	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O

When	NN	O	B-S
the	NN	O	O
Soviet	NN	O	O

collapsed	NN	O	O
there	NN	O	B-S
had	NN	O	O
been	NN	O	O
an	NN	O	O

a	NN	O	O
recent	NN	O	O

The	NN	O	B-S
agreement	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
Gorbachev	NN	O	O
agreed	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
quite	NN	O	O
remarkable	NN	O	O

Now	NN	O	B-S
it	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
remarkable	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O

of	NN	O	O

Nevertheless	NN	O	B-S
he	NN	O	O
agreed	NN	O	O

but	NN	O	B-S
there	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
quid	NN	O	O

namely	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O

Gorbachev	NN	O	B-S

Okay	NN	O	B-S

so	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O

that	NN	O	O

have	NN	O	O
just	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
little	NN	O	O

we	NN	O	O

Then	NN	O	B-S
in	NN	O	O
2006	NN	O	O
we	NN	O	O
ended	NN	O	O
up	NN	O	O
fourth	NN	O	O

It	NN	O	B-S
was	NN	O	O
one	NN	O	O

the	NN	O	O
worst	NN	O	O
World	NN	O	O

we	NN	O	O
've	NN	O	O

actually	NN	O	O

And	NN	O	B-S
then	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
2010	NN	O	O
we	NN	O	O
just	NN	O	O
...	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
know	NN	O	O
what	NN	O	O

We	NN	O	B-S
just	NN	O	O
did	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
play	NN	O	O

we	NN	O	O

Came	NN	O	B-S

But	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O

Fired	NN	O	B-S
us	NN	O	O
up	NN	O	O
for	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
actual	NN	O	O

So	NN	O	B-S
the	NN	O	O
World	NN	O	O

is	NN	O	O

it	NN	O	B-S

the	NN	O	O
World	NN	O	O

,	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
be	NN	O	O
placed	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
but	NN	O	B-S
it	NN	O	O
also	NN	O	O
means	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
get	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
really	NN	O	O
good	NN	O	O
opportunity	NN	O	O

two	NN	O	O
year	NN	O	O
gap	NN	O	O
between	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O

So	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
come	NN	O	O
back	NN	O	O
home	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
revisit	NN	O	O
what	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
need	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
know	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
where	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
team	NN	O	O
's	NN	O	O
at	NN	O	O

And	NN	O	B-S
all	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
sort	NN	O	O

Unfortunately	NN	O	B-S

they	NN	O	O
are	NN	O	O
talking	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O

it	NN	O	O

it	NN	O	O
will	NN	O	O

the	NN	O	O

before	NN	O	O

What	NN	O	B-S
are	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
going	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
talk	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O
here	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
Levico	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
called	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
Character	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
walks	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
words	NN	O	O

There	NN	O	B-S
is	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
whole	NN	O	O

which	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
called	NN	O	O
asymptotic	NN	O	O
groups	NN	O	O

There	NN	O	B-S
are	NN	O	O
groups	NN	O	O

express	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
symmetry	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
some	NN	O	O

Studying	NN	O	B-S
groups	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
bit	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
studying	NN	O	O
symmetry	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

It	NN	O	B-S
's	NN	O	O
very	NN	O	O
beautiful	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
think	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

And	NN	O	B-S
then	NN	O	O
when	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
an	NN	O	O
asymptotic	NN	O	O
way	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
look	NN	O	O
at	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
small	NN	O	O
details	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

It	NN	O	B-S
's	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
from	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
sky	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
look	NN	O	O
at	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
general	NN	O	O
patterns	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

And	NN	O	B-S
there	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
another	NN	O	O
topic	NN	O	O
which	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
very	NN	O	O
important	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
which	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
called	NN	O	O
representation	NN	O	O
theory	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

So	NN	O	B-S
I	NN	O	O
will	NN	O	O
mainly	NN	O	O
talk	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O
how	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
use	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
representation	NN	O	O
theory	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
solve	NN	O	O
all	NN	O	O
kind	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
problems	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
conjectures	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
asymptotic	NN	O	O
groups	NN	O	O
theory	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Why	NN	O	B-S
did	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
choose	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
study	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
?	NN	O	O

First	NN	O	B-S
of	NN	O	O
all	NN	O	O
because	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
beautiful	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

When	NN	O	B-S
I	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
ten	NN	O	O
my	NN	O	B-S
father	NN	O	O
already	NN	O	O
showed	NN	O	O
me	NN	O	O
some	NN	O	O
stuff	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	B-S
the	NN	O	O
beauty	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
imagination	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
quite	NN	O	O
apparent	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
also	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
freedom	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

If	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
study	NN	O	O
physics	NN	O	O
or	NN	O	O
chemistry	NN	O	O
then	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
should	NN	O	O
describe	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
real	NN	O	O
world	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

But	NN	O	B-S
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
build	NN	O	O
your	NN	O	O
own	NN	O	O
structures	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
can	NN	O	O
walk	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
worlds	NN	O	O
created	NN	O	O
by	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
imagination	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
people	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
're	NN	O	O
not	NN	O	O
committed	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
real	NN	O	O
world	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

It	NN	O	B-S
's	NN	O	O
almost	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
God	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
some	NN	O	O
extent	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
can	NN	O	O
create	NN	O	O
worlds	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	B-S
can	NN	O	O
study	NN	O	O
them	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
think	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
's	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
combination	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
beauty	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
imagination	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
freedom	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Many	NN	O	B-S
people	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
many	NN	O	O
students	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
dislike	NN	O	O
math	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Why	NN	O	B-S
do	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
think	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
so	NN	O	O
?	NN	O	O

First	NN	O	B-S
of	NN	O	O
all	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
think	NN	O	O
maybe	NN	O	O
they	NN	O	O
have	NN	O	O
bad	NN	O	O
teachers	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
which	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
problem	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
have	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
have	NN	O	O
very	NN	O	O
good	NN	O	O
teachers	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
if	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
really	NN	O	O
want	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
enjoy	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
succeed	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Probably	NN	O	B-S
some	NN	O	O
people	NN	O	O
mainly	NN	O	O
think	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
scientific	NN	O	O
part	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
it	NN	O	O
–	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
have	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
be	NN	O	O
accurate	NN	O	O
-	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	B-S
they	NN	O	O
see	NN	O	O
less	NN	O	O
these	NN	O	O
elements	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
freedom	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
imagination	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
creation	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Maybe	NN	O	B-S
they	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
precise	NN	O	O
nature	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Also	NN	O	B-S
when	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
talk	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	B-S
notice	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
language	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
very	NN	O	O
important	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	B-S
I	NN	O	O
actually	NN	O	O
notice	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
many	NN	O	O
times	NN	O	O
people	NN	O	O
fail	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
because	NN	O	B-S
they	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
know	NN	O	O
how	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
write	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
composition	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

They	NN	O	B-S
have	NN	O	O
ideas	NN	O	O
but	NN	O	B-S
they	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
not	NN	O	O
formulate	NN	O	O
them	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
right	NN	O	O
way	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Actually	NN	O	B-S
I	NN	O	O
find	NN	O	O
many	NN	O	O
connections	NN	O	O
between	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
literature	NN	O	O
because	NN	O	B-S
almost	NN	O	O
all	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
thing	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
told	NN	O	O
about	NN	O	O
mathematics	NN	O	O
are	NN	O	O
also	NN	O	O
seen	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
literature	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
writing	NN	O	O
because	NN	O	B-S
when	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
write	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
describe	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
real	NN	O	O
world	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
but	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
can	NN	O	O
also	NN	O	O
create	NN	O	O
worlds	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
fiction	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

So	NN	O	B-S
you	NN	O	O
have	NN	O	O
imagination	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	B-S
have	NN	O	O
total	NN	O	O
freedom	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	B-S
can	NN	O	O
invent	NN	O	O
characters	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	B-S
can	NN	O	O
invent	NN	O	O
all	NN	O	O
kind	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
development	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
surprises	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
this	NN	O	O
kind	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
end	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
story	NN	O	O
or	NN	O	O
another	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Also	NN	O	B-S
the	NN	O	O
language	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
important	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
writing	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
literature	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

So	NN	O	B-S
in	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
way	NN	O	O
people	NN	O	O
often	NN	O	O
do	NN	O	O
n't	NN	O	O
know	NN	O	O
how	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
combine	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
two	NN	O	O
fields	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

It	NN	O	B-S
could	NN	O	O
look	NN	O	O
like	NN	O	O
almost	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
opposite	NN	O	O
:	NN	O	O
literature	NN	O	B-S
is	NN	O	O
kind	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
arts	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	B-S
mathematics	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
science	NN	O	O
but	NN	O	B-S
they	NN	O	O
also	NN	O	O
see	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
lot	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
common	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	B-S
there	NN	O	O
where	NN	O	O
mathematician	NN	O	O
who	NN	O	O
were	NN	O	O
writers	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

For	NN	O	B-S
example	NN	O	O
the	NN	O	O
most	NN	O	O
famous	NN	O	O
is	NN	O	O
Lewis	NN	O	O
Carrol	NN	O	O
,	NN	O	O
author	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
Alice	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
're	NN	O	O
not	NN	O	O
only	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
mathematician	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

You	NN	O	B-S
also	NN	O	O
wrote	NN	O	O
two	NN	O	O
collections	NN	O	O
of	NN	O	O
short	NN	O	O
stories	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
novel	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

Why	NN	O	B-S
did	NN	O	O
you	NN	O	O
begin	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
write	NN	O	O
?	NN	O	O

When	NN	O	B-S
I	NN	O	O
was	NN	O	O
quite	NN	O	O
young	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	B-S
was	NN	O	O
interested	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
psychoanalysis	NN	O	O
and	NN	O	O
in	NN	O	O
dreams	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
was	NN	O	O
trying	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
interpret	NN	O	O
my	NN	O	O
dreams	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

I	NN	O	B-S
started	NN	O	O
to	NN	O	O
write	NN	O	O
down	NN	O	O
my	NN	O	O
dreams	NN	O	O
.	NN	O	O

And	NN	O	B-S
then	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
noticed	NN	O	O
that	NN	O	O
I	NN	O	O
cheat	NN	O	O
a	NN	O	O
little	NN	O	O
